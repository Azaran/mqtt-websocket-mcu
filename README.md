# mqtt-websocket-mcu
Library for using MQTT over WebSockets for ESP8266 and ESP32. It prolly won't be perfect. It's just for the project https://github.com/Azaran/pdi2017-team01

It is modified version of https://github.com/odelot/aws-mqtt-websockets . I hope I'm not violating any rules and conditions stated by GNU LGPL.
